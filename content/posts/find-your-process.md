title: Find your process!

I have a habit of focusing on the "next big thing" rather than what I am already good at. This leads me to neglect my current skillset; as a result, I have never quite mastered many things I could have.

I learned this through cooking. Living alone in the city forced me to cook more than I did with my parents. I can cook basic items, but because I always wanted to make something "big and delicious," I spent little time perfecting my omelets. I see this in my professional life, too: I spend more time preparing for my next role than refining the skills required for my current one.
The 60:20:20 Framework

The key is balance. I propose a 60:20:20 rule for time allocation:

    60%: Improving skills that provide immediate utility.

    20%: Developing skills for future roles/aspirations.

    20%: Exploring intriguing topics with no immediate practical use.

T-Shaped Learning is another useful visualizer. The vertical bar represents your deep, immediate skills (your bread and butter), while the horizontal bar covers a large ground of shallow, broad knowledge.
The Pitfalls of Gamification

While learning can be gamified, I am not a fan. It quickly devolves into chasing scores and milestones. Beating records provides a dopamine hit, but people often start chasing the "hit" rather than the actual learning. A process is more reliable and lasting when it does not rely on dopamine spikes.
Simplicity in Process

Modern processes are often just repackaged complexities. Learning is simple, though not necessarily easy. You do not need specific trackers, apps, or complex note-taking strategies. You only need a computer or a pen and paper—whatever works for you. I personally dislike pen and paper; just because articles claim it works doesn’t mean I should use it.

Find your own process and stick with it. Learning is a lonely journey; generic advice often fails. Try things personally and pick the rituals and strategies that build your specific framework.

I will build upon this in 2026, implement these ideas, and write a follow-up article on the results.

Happy New Year!
