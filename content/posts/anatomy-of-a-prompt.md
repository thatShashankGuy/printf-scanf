## Quick Announcement

I started this blog to reflect on my learning and write down my ideas in a more digestible format. I kind of deviated from that by making it very textbook-style, code-centric articles.

They were also extremely long, so‚Äîbased on feedback‚ÄîI‚Äôd like to start over and do some mix-and-match. While I‚Äôll still occasionally write code-heavy articles, I‚Äôll also do these small ‚ÄúTILs‚Äù to jot down raw notes in a more standard format.

I hope you enjoy this, and feel free to send your feedback via email or over LinkedIn.

## What Is Prompting?

Prompting is something we all do in 2025, so I don‚Äôt know who needs a definition‚Äîbut for people living under a rock, here‚Äôs Wikipedia‚Äôs:

> **Prompt**  
> Natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.

We use prompts to generate code, refine emails, decode jargon, and proofread and polish blogs‚Äîbecause we‚Äôre not all great writers! üòâ

A GenAI response is only as good as its prompt. As an engineer who generates scripts, prompting needs to be meticulous‚Äîotherwise most of the time saved via prompting gets eaten up in debugging and even more time in rewriting. (Frustrating stuff.)

## Anatomy of a Prompt

A good prompt can be broken into **five parts**:

1. **Instruction**  
   Tell the model what to do. Be specific, clear, and action-oriented.  
   _Example:_

   ```
   Summarize the following paragraph in 3 bullet points.
   ```

2. **Input Data**  
   Provide the data the LLM will work on: a paragraph, a code snippet, user data, etc. In code scenarios, this is like passing arguments to a function or API body.

3. **Output Format**  
   If you know what your output should look like, give an example. This guides the model‚Äôs structure‚Äîbullet points, assertion outputs, email format, formality level, etc.

4. **Role**  
   Specify the personality, style, or expertise the model should adopt.

   ```
   Respond like a professional doctor explaining to a 10-year-old.

   ```

5. **Context** (optional but powerful)  
   Give background so the model can ground its response. For instance, tell your LLM it‚Äôs an ‚Äúexpert software architect‚Äù when brainstorming architecture.
