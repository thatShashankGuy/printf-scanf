I've been thinking about this for a while now. I write all my markdown files for this blog in micro or nvim - I really like the terminal experience. Ever since I wrote my first .bat file for my job, something about the terminal feels cooler than any IDE, notepad, or editor. Especially when you use VSCode - don't get me wrong, I love VSCode and its never-ending quality-of-life extensions and features. But it's such a clunky piece of software.

So I built this new CLI tool to help me write my thoughts well without ever leaving the command line. One of the upsides of this new era of coding agents is you write more software which was not necessary but important - and you only had time for necessary, not enough for important. I was able to build this tool in a couple of hours with Open Code GLM 4.7 and my new favorite replacement for Node - BUN.

This is by the way a test. I write my raw thoughts, "why CLI," my CLI processes it into markdown - it's pretty simple. I have also added some commands to git commit and push as well as build my Hugo (yes, my blogs are in Hugo).

One thing I am experimenting with this tool, and this might turn people off, is using AI in my writing. Hold on - I am not gonna give ChatGPT my prompt and ask it to generate an article. Instead, I have added an AI flag which feeds my raw - bad grammar, spelling error-ridden text to an AI to create a nice markdown to read. Often thoughts are ugly, and I don't want to stop writing to do semantic changes or open a browser to check if spelling is correct. So that's it - I am gonna add the repo link down below for people to check out.
