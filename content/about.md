### Introduction 


Hi, my name is Shashank! With over 6 years of experience in software development, database pipelines, DevOps, and production support, I've encountered a wide range of technologies. I have provided a link to my resume if you want to know more.

One of my hobbies is reading, learning, and implementing various tech-related topics. I experiment with tech paradigms, cloud infrastructure, programming languages, design patterns, and architecture, often spending a lot of time digging into technical documentation, articles, and books.

Apart from tech, I love reading fiction, history, and comedy. I am also a single-player video game fan who refuses to go to online lobbies to be told how much I suck.

### About **_printf/scanf_**

I started writing about my learnings and findings as an effort to get better at note-taking. I failed, but developed an interest in research and documenting my findings.

I used to publish my articles exclusively on LinkedIn, and it turns out many people have found them helpful.

I also have random topics I want to talk about, but asking a friend to sit through my venting may not be the best idea.

So I decided to start **printf/scanf**â€”a place to consolidate my writings, research, notes, and general thought processes for you, the readers, to check out, and for me to document my own growth.

### Disclaimer

I am no SME on any of these subjects, and while I will try to provide links to all the references, please make sure to check out proper documentation and other resources once you go through my simplified blog.

### Now that's out of the way

Thank you, and happy reading!
