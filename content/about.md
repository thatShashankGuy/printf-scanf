I am based in India. I love video games and reading, and I prefer hardcopies over digital copies. Between gaming and writing software programs, I spend most of my time in front of various screens.

I have also developed a liking for writing technical blogs. I am working on a few currently and will be uploading them here in the blog section; feel free to check them out.
