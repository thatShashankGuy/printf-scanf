Thank you for visiting my little site! My name is Shashank, and I am a software engineer with 6 years of experience in IT and technology.

I have worked in various rolesâ€”from server management to full-stack development to RPA automation engineering. In my current role, I work with various cloud services, from AWS to Azure, building, deploying, and maintaining cloud-native applications and pipelines.

To know more about my work history and experience, please download my resume.

I am based in India. I love video games and reading, and I prefer hardcopies over digital copies. Between gaming and writing software programs, I spend most of my time in front of various screens.

I have also developed a liking for writing technical blogs. I am working on a few currently and will be uploading them here in the blog section; feel free to check them out.
