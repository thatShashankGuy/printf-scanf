            When starting a project, one of the earliest design decisions you
            need to make is selecting a database. There are various databases
            available in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, most databases were of SQL flavors, grouped as Relational
            Databases, and they used the de facto method of saving data into
            tables and establishing relationships between these tables. You can

            However, with the advent of NoSQL databases, this paradigm was
            challenged, opting for a more relaxed and schema-less approach,

            Changes to a database, such as writes, updates, or deletes, are
            carried out through transactions.
            <em
              >A transaction represents a unit of work performed within a
              database management system (DBMS) against a database</em
            >. Database Transaction Models are a set of rules that determine how
            a DBMS organizes, stores, and manipulates data. A DBMS can support
            multiple transaction models, and a transaction will adhere to the
            ruleset of the chosen transaction model.

            ACID properties define a set of guarantees that a DBMS must provide
            to ensure data consistency and reliability, even in the face of
            system failures.<em>Most of RDBMS are ACID compliant</em>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Atomicity</strong> ensures that a transaction is treated
                as a single, indivisible unit of work. If any part of a
                transaction fails (e.g., due to an error or exception), the
                entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains
                unchanged. Atomicity ensures that the database is always in a
                consistent state, even in the presence of failures.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Consistency</strong> guarantees that a transaction
                brings the database from one consistent state to another
                consistent state. It enforces integrity constraints, ensuring
                that data remains valid and adheres to defined rules and
                constraints.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Isolation</strong> ensures that concurrent transactions
                do not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to
                run in isolation, as if it were the only transaction being
                processed. It prevents one transaction from reading or modifying
                data that another transaction is currently modifying.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Durability</strong> guarantees that once a transaction
                is committed, its effects will persist even in the event of a
                system crash or failure. This involves writing data to
                non-volatile storage, such as hard drives.

            Consider a banking system where customers can transfer money between
            accounts, make deposits, and withdraw funds. ACID properties prevent
            issues such as incomplete transactions due to system failures,
            incorrect balances, or data violations.

          <p>
            BASE is often used in distributed and NoSQL databases where strict
            ACID guarantees are not required, and a degree of eventual
            consistency is acceptable.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                In <strong>Basically Available</strong>, the emphasis is on
                providing basic availability of the system. Even if failures
                occur, the system remains operational and responsive to user
                requests, although it may not provide real-time consistency.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Soft state</strong> means that the state of the system
                can change over time, even without input, due to factors like
                eventual consistency, background processes, or the expiration of
                temporary data.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Eventually consistency</strong> implies that, given time
                and no further updates, all replicas of the data in a
                distributed system will converge to the same state. It
                acknowledges that in a distributed environment, immediate
                consistency might not always be achievable due to network delays
                and the distributed nature of the system.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Consider a social media distributed app where fast performance takes
            precedence over immediate data consistency. In such cases, trading
            off atomicity and consistency for basic availability and eventual
            consistency is more sensible.

            It&rsquo;s important to note that ACID and BASE serve drastically

            While working with distributed systems, we also need to consider the
            CAP theorem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer&rsquo;s theorem, is a
            fundamental concept in distributed computing that describes the
            trade-offs that distributed systems must make between three key
            properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Consistency (C)</strong> refers to the requirement that
                all nodes in a distributed system have the same data at the same
                time.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Availability (A)</strong> means that every request made
                to a distributed system, whether for reading or writing data,
                should receive a response, without guaranteeing that the
                response contains the most up-to-date data.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>Partition Tolerance (P)</strong> is the ability of a
                distributed system to continue functioning and providing
                responses even when there are network partitions or
                communication failures between nodes.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            According to the CAP theorem, it is impossible for a distributed
            system to simultaneously achieve all three properties (Consistency,
            Availability, and Partition Tolerance) at their maximum levels.
            Instead, distributed systems must make trade-offs among these
            properties.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance):</strong> In a
                CP system, consistency is prioritized over availability. The
                system ensures that all nodes have the most recent data and can
                tolerate network partitions, but it may sacrifice availability
                when network issues occur. This approach is typical in databases
                that prioritize data consistency.

                <strong>CA (Consistency and Availability):</strong> In a CA
                system, consistency and availability are prioritized, but it may
                not be able to tolerate network partitions. Such systems may
                choose to reject requests or wait for network issues to be
                resolved before responding. These systems are often found in
                traditional, non-distributed databases.

                <strong>AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance):</strong> In
                an AP system, availability and partition tolerance are
                prioritized over strict consistency. The system may provide
                responses even if the data is not immediately consistent across
                all nodes. This approach is common in distributed NoSQL
                databases and systems that need to stay operational in the
                presence of network partitions.

            In conclusion, ACID and BASE transaction models, along with the CAP
            theorem, play pivotal roles in the design and operation of modern
            database systems. Each has its own strengths and trade-offs, making
            them suitable for specific use cases. Understanding these paradigms
            is essential for making informed decisions in database design and
            architecture.
