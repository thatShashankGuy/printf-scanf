But as you see, I have not written anything since last year. Why?

  <section><p>This is not my usual technical/CSE adjacent post. My articles are mostly tech-related, but I wanted to discuss something different today.</p>
<p>For the past few months, precisely six, I have not been writing anything. I re-did my <code>Svelte</code> SPA site and turned it into this <code>Hugo</code> based SSG, removing the clutter to focus on writing.</p>
<p>But as you see, I have not written anything since last year. Why?</p>
<p>Firstly, in the past quarter, I switched jobs, and the transitional period comes with a lot of uncertainty in routine. Second, I suck at routines.</p>
<p>Today I would like to talk about two things: <em>Motivation and Boredom</em>.</p>
<p>While job hunting, I was reading a lot, doing LeetCode, and building the now-defunct parisar. I was incredibly productive because I was motivated to be interview-ready. Since starting my new job, I’ve hardly invested time in tech beyond my daily work.</p>
<p>Does that mean I need to put down notice again? No, not really. If I solely rely on motivation to be productive, I will be productive twice a month.</p>
<p>I need to be bored. You need to be bored.
Boredom brings consistency. If you are okay with being bored, you do not require stimuli to do the needful.</p>
<p>Two years back, I got around 95 kilograms—the heaviest I ever got. I decided to hit the gym, get on a better diet, and I lost about 15 kilos. I also put on some muscle. But since then, I have been around the same weight with a similar amount of muscle. I did not grow because I did not put in more work, but I also did not put on more weight because, to me, working out is just a boring task I do regardless of how I am feeling. I work out 3 to 5 days a week, 60 to 80 minutes per session. I would love to get serious about my workout too, but I am not bummed about it either.</p>
<p>The thing is, my body knows that I will do it once I get to the gym, and for those 3 to 5 days, I don&rsquo;t need to be motivated to leave my house, go to the gym, and work out.</p>
<p>We need to be okay with working/working out/reading without motivation, an external push, a deadline, or a prize. We need to sit, embrace the boredom, and do the boring stuff.</p>
<p>I am working on a series of posts I call <strong>Straight from the Docs</strong>. These posts won’t be opinions or guides but extracts simplified from technical documentation and books on Go, Node, .NET, and Databases, among other topics. This means I am going to start doing the most boring thing in the world: digging into technical documents and books as much as I can. These are not quirky blogs but official docs and well-published mammoth books to identify topics and distill them for this site.</p>
<p>Wish me luck, and I will see you soon with the next article.</p>
