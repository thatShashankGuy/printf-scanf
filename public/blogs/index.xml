      <description>This is not my usual technical/CSE adjacent post. My articles are mostly tech-related, but I wanted to discuss something different today.&#xA;For the past few months, precisely six, I have not been writing anything. I re-did my Svelte SPA site and turned it into this Hugo based SSG, removing the clutter to focus on writing.&#xA;But as you see, I have not written anything since last year. Why?&#xA;Firstly, in the past quarter, I switched jobs, and the transitional period comes with a lot of uncertainty in routine.</description>

      <description>About three months ago, I felt intense pressure in my career. I did not feel like learning anything, and doing my job was a struggle. At that point in time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand what was going on, but now I know I was going through a phase of burnout.&#xA;Burnouts are quite common in the workforce, and you will find hundreds of people sharing their stories of burnout.&#xA;One thing you will come across quite often when you search for &amp;lsquo;how to deal with burnouts in tech&amp;rsquo; is to just take a break.</description>

      <title>Database Paradigms - ACID, BASE and CAP in brief</title>

      <description>When starting a project, one of the earliest design decisions you need to make is selecting a database. There are various databases available in the market.&#xA;Initially, most databases were of SQL flavors, grouped as Relational Databases, and they used the de facto method of saving data into tables and establishing relationships between these tables. You can read more about History of SQL.&#xA;However, with the advent of NoSQL databases, this paradigm was challenged, opting for a more relaxed and schema-less approach, saving data as objects rather than in rigid tables with relationships.</description>

      <title>Pointers in Go</title>
      <link>https://shashankshekhar.pages.dev/blogs/gopointers/</link>

      <description>In Go, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. We use the ampersand (&amp;amp;) operator to get the memory address of a variable, and the asterisk (*) operator to declare a pointer variable or to access the value pointed to by a pointer.&#xA;In the example code provided, p is a pointer to the variable x. We can use the * operator to access the value stored in the memory location pointed to by p.</description>

      <description>Introduction Asynchronous programming is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished.&#xA;Consider Node/ Browser Architecture , When program starts it start a main thread on which wil run your javascript program . While one set of instructions ( code ) is running on this thread the thread is busy</description>

      <title>The Typescript Programming Guide</title>
      <link>https://shashankshekhar.pages.dev/blogs/typescript/</link>

      <description>Introduction By now, TypeScript has emerged as a fully-fledged de facto standard for writing secure, enterprise-grade Node apps. I am building this guide from my experience and the TypeScript handbook to offer a brief introduction for those transitioning from JavaScript but please beware I am no SME on typescript. Readers should have some familiarity with JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). As we all are busy people I have kept the guide as concise as possible while being as clear as I can.</description>
